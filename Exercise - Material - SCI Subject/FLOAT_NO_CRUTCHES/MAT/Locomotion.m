%REPORT LOCOMOTION

%-compute the dynamics of a selected of a least of 20 of kinetic parameters( knee angle, step height) and 5 EMG parameters (Perak-peak amplitude) , you can decide the parameters that you want
%-you have to perform PCA( YOU SHOULD PERFORM THE pca for the two classes
%that are the healthy and un-healthy patients)

% We should compare both the case with our data and the unhealthy patients.
% 
% Focused on the values that you can extract from the main parameters,
% there are seven parameteres: shoulder, hip, knee, toe,heel,ankle,and
% probably one at the hand.

%the data set is formed by 3 patients--> the SHS, you need to understand
%how to extract the data from the markers by reading papers from kinetics
%and EMG


%the data gives the absolute position of the markers, all the data are
%referring to the same global frame.
